### Cheeseboard Mobile

This project is a current work-in-progress. The app will give users the ability to choose from a list list of ingredients and then receive push notification on days the Cheeseboard makes pizza with any of the selected ingredients.

I currently have the backend finished (it's a Ruby on Rails API, hosted on heroku). It is essentially a web scraper that visits the Cheeseboard web page every day, reads the menu, and adds the pizza to the database.

I have the skeleton for the app ready. Right now it is able to display the current day's pizza. What I now need to implement is the ability for a user to select ingredients.
